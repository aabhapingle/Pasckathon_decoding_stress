# Problem Statement - <br>
Lack of a platform where a user can analyse his/her stress level if he/she is facing any medical problem like severe headache, anxiety or sleepless nights or a platform where a patient can have one to one interaction with medical counsellors and can maintain his/her progress reports.<br>

# Idea - <br>
To create a platform where the users can analyse their stress levels if they are facing any medical problems like headache or sleepless nights in their daily lives. The user will also get the facility of online medical counselling by registered practioners on the platform who will regularly monitor the progress of the patient and provide online medical guidance. <br>
